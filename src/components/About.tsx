      <h2 className="about__section-title">Who we are</h2>
      <p className="about__text">
        The NGO "Let’s grow together" – Danilovgrad, Montenegro, is a
        non-governmental organization, which has been founded in 2007. It was
        founded by a group of parents of children and youth with developmental
        disabilities, guided by a common goal and mission to improve the quality
        of life of their children. At the very beginning, the Association had 7
        members, while the expertise meetings were held once a week in the
        rented premises of the Red Cross.
      </p>
      <p className="about__text">
        After a short period of time, the NGO unfortunately stopped working,
        until the 2013, when the parents of children and young people with
        developmental disabilities united again, and renewed the work of the
        Association with the support of the Municipality of Danilovgrad. Now we
        are proud to have about 50 members, aged from 3 to 35 years, while we
        conduct professional treatments and occupational therapy workshops in
        the premises of the association located on the following address: Str.
        Novice Skerovica b.b. 81410 – Danilovgrad, Montenegro.

        <li className="about__text">
          As a non-governmental organization, we have been making efforts for
          five years to solve the problem of social exclusion, through the
          active implementation of occupational therapy workshops for adult
          members in which they are trained in weaving and decoupage techniques.
          In this way, young people with disabilities were given the opportunity
          to make various products using weaving and decoupage techniques, as
          well as to master various skills and knowledge in the field of
          handicrafts. With the help of technical assistants, young people with
          developmental disabilities create decorative and useful items. Through
          work and occupational therapy workshops, young people with
          developmental disabilities fill their free time and improve the
          quality of their lives. Through work in the workshop, which is
          continuous, they create work habits and reach the maximum of their
          potential, which they did not have the opportunity to express;
        </li>
        <li className="about__text">
          Young people with developmental disabilities were trained to operate a
          T-shirt press machine under the guidance of an instructor. Working on
          the press, we managed to make a large number of t-shirts to order, but
          also for the needs of our Association;
        </li>
        <li className="about__text">
          Another training that was successfully conducted in our Association is
          the computer training. Computer training is a step up in the process
          of educating young people with disabilities. Young people with
          disabilities had the opportunity to master the basics of computers
          with the help of programmers and thus learn how to complete their free
          time by using the basics of the Internet and technology;
        </li>
        <li className="about__text">
          Through the Institute for Employment of Montenegro Public Competition,
          we managed to master the training on the laser cutting and engraving
          machine, which is currently owned by the association. The training,
          which lasted 3 months, was mastered by 8 adult members, 6 PWDs were
          then employed for 6 months (during the duration of the project), and
          the 2nd PWD for another 9 months after the end of the project. The
          target groups mastered the basics of the machine, and were able to
          engrave and cut many personalized details that they colored and
          decorated as wished;
        </li>
        <li className="about__text">
          Also, 8 young people with disabilities successfully completed training
          on a small-format digital press. Young people with disabilities are
          trained to work on the following: printing, cutting, crimping, and
          about the basic knowledge of the material used.

        We are proud to mention that we are the founders of the Traditional
        Masquerade Ball in our town, which has been held for five years in a
        row. The masquerade ball has become recognizable in the Municipality of
        Danilovgrad, especially because of its primary goal - the socialization
        of children and young people with disabilities. Our main goal is, as in
        all previous years, to create connections between our association and
        schools, as well as kindergartens in the surrounding area. On this day,
        we give the opportunity to all children, both those without
        developmental disabilities and those with developmental disabilities, to
        enter the world of their favorite heroes in whose masks they will
        present themselves. In 2020, the Masquerade Ball was not held due to the
        pandemic caused by COVID19.
      </p>
      <div className="about__divider"></div>
      <p className="about__text">
        We have a LICENSE which pertains to the psychological counseling; this
        fact represents the seriousness and professionalism of our organization.
        We have broken prejudices against people with disabilities in the
        territory of our municipality; we have become recognized as an
        organization that encourages creativity, work, and removes barriers that
        existed until recently. We became recognizable even outside the borders
        of our city, we had an extensive campaign through guest appearances on
        television shows, newspaper articles, and through social networks you
        have the opportunity to follow our work.
      </p>
      <p className="about__text">
        We also performed many exhibitions and shows with our products, donor
        evenings, performances... We cooperate with numerous important
        institutions in the local community, which are of great help to us.
      </p>
      <p className="about__text">
        Therefore, we look forward of having your support and interest towards
        our activities, as the target group we are focused on - definitely needs
        and deserves the full attention of our community.
